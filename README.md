Hi, I’m @cnanders

I'm a co-founder at [Hooktheory](https://www.hooktheory.com) where we use data from over 30,000 popular songs to make writing music just like magic.  I'm also a scientist at [Berkeley Lab](https://www.lbl.gov) where I create EUV / X-Ray optical systems for semiconductor manufacturing applications.
