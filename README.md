Hi, I’m @cnanders

I'm a co-founder at Hooktheory where we use data from over 30,000 popular songs to make writing music just like magic.  [linktree/hooktheory](https://linktr.ee/Hooktheory).  I'm also a scientist at Berkeley Lab where I create EUV / X-Ray optical systems for semiconductor manufacturing applications.
